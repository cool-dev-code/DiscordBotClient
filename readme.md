Discord Bot Client is a custom [Discord](https://discord.com/app) client that aims to
support bot accounts and be aimed at power-users.


The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
third parties. However, this application is not an official product by
Discord Inc.

    </td>
  </table>

### Building from source

In order to execute the following commands, you need to install **NodeJS v16 or**
higher. You can find nodejs packages at https://nodejs.org/en.
On top of that, you need to have **git** installed. It can be found at
https://git-scm.com/downloads.


**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

Open a command line and execute the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/DiscordBotClient.git
cd DiscordBotClient
git clone https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/VencordDBC.git
npm run requirement
npm run build
```

This will create an executable called `DiscordBotClient` or `DiscordBotClient.exe` in the `dist` folder depending on whether you are using Windows or not.

### Login

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

## Credits

Thanks to [ChrisEric](https://github.com/CE1CECL) for helping me create a local proxy server! (code)

This project was mainly inspired by [SamuelScheit](https://github.com/SamuelScheit)
[Discord Bot Client](https://github.com/SamuelScheit/discord-bot-client), which he sadly didn't
develop any further.

And a big thank to [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) developers for making it easier for me to create this app
